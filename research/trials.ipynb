The recommended dietary allowances  (RDA) were first established out of concern that America’s overseas  World War II troops were not consuming enough daily nutrients  to maintain good health. The first Food and Nutrition Board was  created in 1941, and in the same year set recommendations for the  adequate intakes of caloric energy and eight essential nutrients.  These were disseminated to officials responsible for food relief for  armed forces and civilians supporting the war effort. Since 1980,  the dietary guidelines have been reevaluated and updated every  five years by the advisory committees of the US Department of  Agriculture (USDA) and the US Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS). The guidelines are continually revised to keep up  with new scientific evidence-based conclusions on the importance  of nutritional adequacy and physical activity to overall health.  While dietary recommendations set prior to 1980 focused only on  preventing nutrient inadequacy, the current dietary guidelines have  the additional goals of promoting health, reducing chronic disease,  and decreasing the prevalence of overweight and obesity.
