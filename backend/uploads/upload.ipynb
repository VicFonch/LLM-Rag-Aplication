Although assured the support of satellite nations (Finland, Rumania, Hungary), Germans are at a disadvantage because of overextended supply lines and battle exhaustion. WESTERN EUROPE—Although Adolf Hitler has by this time abandoned plans for invasion of Eng- land (Operation SEA LION) as result of defeat of Luftwaffe in Battle of Britain (8 August–31 October 1940), German planes continue active over England.

RAF, after attacking enemy shipping and troops in Kota Bharu area, withdraws from the Kelantan airfields to Kuantan, far to S.

TUNISIA—18 Army Group: With surrender of Gen Messe, Rommel’s successor, who is notified of his promotion to marshal on this date, Tunisia Campaign ends. 14 May ALEUTIAN IS.—On Attu, Massacre Bay force, employing 2d Bn of 32d Inf on left and 3d Bn of 17th on right, continues fruitless and costly efforts to break into Jarmin Pass. Holtz Bay force prepares for strong southward attack but postpones it since 3d Bn of 32d Inf is unable to reach attack positions in time. Adverse weather conditions limit air sup- port of troops, but surface vessels continue to bom- bard enemy positions. PANTELLERIA—Mediterranean Air Command orders sea and air blockade of the island. 15 May U.S.—CCS decide to give first priority to con- struction of Assam airfields; set goal of 7,000 tons a month to China, to be reached by 1 July. ALEUTIAN IS.—3d Bn, 17th Inf, is withdrawn from Massacre Bay line on Attu, leaving 2d Bn, 32d, to continue attack. No progress is made, de- spite close arty support before and after jump-off. Dense fog postpones attack of Holtz Bay force until 1100. As fog is lifting it is discovered that enemy has withdrawn to ridge in center of valley, abandon- ing prepared positions and quantities of food and ammunition. Pursuit of enemy across open valley is slowed by enemy fire from commanding heights and is further handicapped by an Allied air strike that hits 7th Div forces by mistake.

Some progress is made toward Makunsha on left, but efforts to overrun Harakiri Gulch and push to coast via Para- dise Valley are largely futile. 4th Mar Div attacks with 23d, 24th, and 25th Regts abreast, from left to right, in expanded zone, making rapid progress against sporadic resistance except on left, where 23d Marines is strongly opposed while attempting to push into Paradise Valley from W and is out of contact with 24th Marines. 24th Marines gains 1,400–1,800 yards. 25th Marines moves quickly up E coast, assisted by naval gunfire, to Mt.
